# Genshin Impact Spiral Abyss Compilation of Valid Teams

This is a curated csv file of valid teams to use in the Spiral Abyss mode for the game Genshin Impact.

&nbsp;
## Who uses this list?
- Genshin Randomizer (TBD)

## Criteria

The criteria for a "valid team" will always be arbitrary, but the criteria used here is as follows:

- A supermajority of players (70%+) can use any team here and clear Spiral Abyss with 33-36 stars
- Players may have to swap around artifacts/weapons but most players have a "pool" of both to switch around

Likely setups the average player has includes:
- 5* star characters + weapons (C1 / R1)
- 4* star characters + weapons (C2-C6 / R2-R6)
- A mix of level 80+ characters (5* star or important 4* star characters)
- A mix of level 70+ characters (important 4* star characters)
- 4th ascension (60/70) support characters
- Talent levels 6+ on most above characters for key abilities

## Aggregation Method

Currently the data here is supplied by the following:

**Manual**
- Keqingmains character guides
- gcsim database
- Personal testing with above average setup

**Automated**
- TBD

## Contributing

Pull requests will NOT be taken. A website is planned for user submission or omission requests. In the meantime if there is a team you feel is missing or one that does not meet the above criteria, please create an issue.
